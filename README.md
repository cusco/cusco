### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm a technology enthusiast, currently working at Qintess EMEA.
- 🐧 My favourite Operating System is [DEBIAN](https://debian.org), mostly due to the [Social Contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract)
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on ... nothing? Well maybe something that I would believe to be beneficial for the planet..?
- 🤔 I'm looking for help on how to become a better person.. every day!
- 💬 Ask me about anything! I have solid grasps on tech, but feel free to ask me about non tech stuff too!
- 📫 How to reach me: [Linkedin](https://t.ly/mKzr)
